# This downloads the query engine binary specific to the environment.

# This Python command finds the directory where the Prisma client is installed.
# We assume the query engine is in the subdirectory 'binaries' within the package installation.

# A simpler and more direct approach for the shell environment is often a glob search:

# Copying the binary to the project root (./) is the most common way to resolve
